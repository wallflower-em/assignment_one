            Hi my name is Em, I grew up on the coast of South Australia with my
            parents and younger brother. Both my parents were born in Australia,
            however my grandmother on my Dad’s side grew up in Button, Dorset in
            England. The only language I speak is English, however I would love to
            learn Japanese.

            I am a bit of musical theatre geek and have attending
            musicals since I was 13, where my grandparents took me to see fame.
            Shortly after this experience I decided to start collecting programs from
            all the musicals I have been to, I have over 20 of them. My favourite
            musical I have seen to date would have to be Billy Elliott, the
            choreography, lighting, and music itself is phenomenal. Over the next year
            I have tickets for Hamilton, Hairspray, and 9 to 5.

            I have previously studied a Bachelor of Arts, with a special interest in community
            development and sociology. However, I wasn’t very passionate about it and
            withdrew to focus more on work. I now work handling complex complaints and
            financial hardship matters, which is interesting however doesn’t hold much
            passion for me anymore.

        Interest in IT
      </h2>
        
        <p>
            Since the moment we got our first home PC when I was ten, I have been
            interested in computers, however I believe my passion is really in
            programming. I spent hours learning HTML when I was younger, the aim at
            the time was to get a myspace page that not only looked nice but also
            played music and have cool effects on each section.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have been told I have a natural talent when it comes to understanding software and learning
            to navigate it quickly this has only fuelled my desire to learn more about
            the technology and software that is around me. It was towards the middle
            of this year that I decided that this passion I had for programming should
            be used to gain a job in something I would be interested in.
        </p>

        <p>
            I set out to enrol in a course that would enable me to do this in a reasonable time and
            gain a useful qualification at the end, as I work full time, I also needed
            the course to be able to be done after work or on weekends. I looked on a
            few local study options, but none offered the flexibility I needed, then I
            looked on OUA. OUA offered the flexibility I needed and RMIT offered the
            time frame I wanted to complete the course I had been looking at.
        </p>

  <div class="Job">     
    <h2> Ideal Job</h2>
    <p>
      The job I would like to obtain within the IT industry is a full-stack
      developer position. From the research I have conducted, the role of a full
      stack developer is to be competent in all programs used in both back-end
      and front-end developers, making them capable of providing an end-to-end
      service. The skills you require to become a full stack developer are being
      proficient in the following programming languages:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML, CSS and JavaScript – for front end development</li>
      <li>JavaScript frameworks such as Angular JS, React and Amber.</li>
      <li>Python, Ruby, Java, PHP and .Net. – for back-end development</li>
      <li>MySQL, Oracle and MongoDB. – for database management</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You must also have soft skills like organizational, time management,
      verbal and written communication, problem-solving and attention to detail.
      I am fortunate to have developed all these skills as a complaint handler
      throughout my professional life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though you may be able to obtain a role as a full-stack developer without
      formal qualifications and experience alone, it is recommended that you
      have a computer science degree focusing on software development. Examples
      would be a bachelor's in IT with a minor in software development or a
      certificate IV in programming. I have decided to do a Bachelor of IT to
      obtain the above skills.
    </p>
    <h3>10 Year plan</h3>
    <p>
      Below is my 10-year plan of how I wish to obtain a degree and progress to
      a senior full-stack developer role:
    </p>
    <p>Year 1: Complete 8 units of Bachelor of IT</p>
    <p>
      Year 2: Complete additional eight units and gain an internship to gain
      hands-on experience
    </p>
    <p>
      Year 3: Complete final units of Bachelor of IT – Continue with an
      internship or see if I can gain an entry-level full-time position as a
      junior developer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Year 4: If was unsuccessful in gaining a junior developer role – apply
      again till able to obtain a junior position. Also, complete at least one
      career development course to increase my knowledge in one of the
      following:
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript frameworks such as Angular JS, React and Amber.</li>
        <li>Server-side languages such as Python, Ruby, Java, PHP and .Net.</li>
        <li>Database technology such as MySQL, Oracle and MongoDB.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Year 5 - 6: Continue in the Junior role and continue studying independently to increase knowledge and stay updated with changes.</p>
    <p>Year 7: Start to apply for mid-level full-stack developer roles.</p>
    <p>Year 8: Stay in a mid-level full stack developer role until year 10.</p>
    <p>Year 10: Apply for full stack developer senior roles</p>

    <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
         <p> I don’t think the results of these tests will influence my behaviour in a team. However, these tests are pretty accurate to my personality. I am naturally good at creating process and getting those around me to live by them. On the flip side though, I can be very stubborn and somewhat direct at in the way I put things. 
        These types of traits are the things I am most mindful of when working within a group. I generally try to ensure I am not being overly direct and bossy and that I also take on board other opinions.

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <h3>Overview </h3>
    <P>For my project, I want to create a website that assists in finding sensory-friendly places for those with autism or other neurodivergence. Places like Woolworths, Coles and Kmart have introduced quiet hours, where they turn down the lights, lower the music and reduce the number of over-speaker announcements. The website would include a map with locations highlighted that are sensory-friendly, similar to the feature google maps offers with locating cafes, restaurants and public places. Along with the map feature, you would have the opportunity to submit locations and rate the ones on how sensory-friendly they were, similar to yelp or google reviews.</P>
    <h3>Motivation</h3>
    <p>According to the abs, as of 2015, 164,000 people with autism were living in Australia. This number increased by 42% from 2012. It has been shown that people with autism often experience sensory burnout when they constantly have to face over-stimulated environments like supermarkets and restaurants. An app like this would assist people with autism to ensure that they can better manage their social experiences and decrease the amount of time they experience sensory burnout. Sensory issues can easily be met without disturbing the neurotypical sense of normality. Things like changing the type of lighting from fluorescent to something a little less harsh, turning down music, and not using fragrance smells.</p>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <P>People with autism commonly have both hypersensitivity and hyposensitivity. Hypersensitivity can be experienced by exposure to bright lights, sounds, smells and even textures. Hyposensitivity can be displayed in the constant need for movement, attraction to loud sounds, bright lights and vibrant colours. If a person with autism is constantly in contact with their sensitivities, it can result in sensory overload, hindering their ability to cope. It may result in feelings of intense anxiety and may result in them isolating themselves from friends, family, and the general community. 
        Sensory-friendly venues would have to meet requirements like no harsh fluorescent lighting, turning down or not having music playing, reducing voice-over announcements, and not having excess clutter on the store like stock waiting to be put away. The website would provide a place where users could rate places based on how sensory-friendly a place is, selecting a score out of 5 for lighting, music and general ambience. Like that seen in an app that the SA government has recently released called Pavely, Pavely gives the option for the public to rate public areas, venues and shops on how disability-friendly they are. 
        In addition to the rating system, people would be able to comment advising on the positives and negatives of the venue. A review section would hopefully provide feedback to the venue's owner and make them more aware of the needs of people with autism and sensory sensitivities. 
        I picture this idea as a website first, then evolving into IOS and Android applications later. The general design would be like that seen on googles maps, where you can click on restaurants in your area, and it will highlight them on a map. I would like it to highlight venues catering to sensory-sensitive people and have a separate category for places with designated "sensory hours" that are sensory-friendly, like Woolworths and Kmart. A website like this would make it easier for those with autism or other sensory-sensitive disabilities to navigate their daily lives and reduce stress and anxiety when trying to complete a simple task that neurotypical people do easily.
        The Australian institute of health and welfare reports that many National Disability Agreement (NDA) service users with autism reported having other disabilities. 33% of users with autism reported having an intellectual disability, 8% a psychiatric disability, 7% a specific learning disability or attention deficit disorder, 6% a speech disability, 5% a physical disability and 4% a neurological disability.
        Due to this, the design for the website and future applications would focus on providing an accessibility-friendly website. Ensuring that the correct heading structure is used, the reason for this is because screen readers can use heading structure to navigate content. Additionally, taking into consideration the colours used in the branding and theme of the website. The most common form of colour deficiency is red/green colour deficiency. Additionally, people with learning difficulties can use colour to distinguish between different content. To ensure that both groups' needs are met, we can use white to break up the blocks of the colour. 
        </P>
    <h3>Tools & Technology</h3>
    <p>The type of software I would like to use to develop this website would be google API, and this would give me a good starting place to grow off as the google database is already well established. I would use the API for places, routes, and maps. I would hope that using the already established program from Google would give me a building block to work off. In addition, I would like to use an application called UserWay. UserWay helps make websites more accessible to those with disabilities. Accessibility is essential to the app as the comorbidity with other disabilities is high.
    </p>
    <h3>Skills Required</h3>
    <p>The skills I would need to make this website would be as follows:</p>
    <Ul>
        <li>Wireframing</li>
        <li>HTML and CSS for the construction of the website</li>
        <li>jQuery and JavaScript  API integration and calls.</li>
        <li>Python</li>
    </Ul>
    <p>I don’t think I would be able to learn all the skills to the level needed to complete this website within the study period. However, I would be able to learn wireframing and create one for the website. As I have some knowledge of HTML, I think I could gain enough knowledge for HTML and CSS. However, things like python, jQuery and JavaScript would probably not be feasible for me to learn to a high enough standard to implement all the features I would like for the website. </p>
    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>If I was able to make this website successful it would mean that a lot of people with autism would be able to go out more often and feel like they are having “normal” social experiences without having to deal with the potential of burnout and sensory overload. Though this website may not completely solve the sensory issues face by those with autism it would assist in making people with autism feel safer and more “normal” going into public spaces if they knew that they weren’t being faced strong lighting, loud sounds and other things that cause sensory overload. </p>
